# Binary Search Tree (BST) 

## Functionality

1. **Build a balanced BST**  
   Create a binary search tree from a sorted array of unique numbers.

2. **Tree operations**  
   - Insert and delete nodes  
   - Find a node by value  
   - Calculate node depth  
   - Get node height  
   - Check if the tree is balanced  
   - Rebalance the tree if unbalanced

3. **Tree traversals**  
   Print tree elements using:  
   - Level-order traversal  
   - Pre-order traversal  
   - Post-order traversal  
   - In-order traversal

4. **Driver script features**  
   - Generate a random array of numbers less than 100 to build the tree  
   - Confirm the tree is balanced  
   - Print traversals  
   - Insert numbers greater than 100 to unbalance the tree  
   - Confirm the tree is unbalanced  
   - Rebalance the tree  
   - Confirm the tree is balanced again  
   - Print traversals again
