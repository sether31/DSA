## Hash Map

1. **hash(key)** takes a key and produces a hash code with it.

2. **set(key, value)** takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten. 

3. **get(key)** takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null.

4. **has(key)** takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.

5. **remove(key)** takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.

6. **length()** returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.

7. **clear()** removes all entries in the hash map.

8. **keys()** returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.

9. **values()** returns an array containing all the values.

10. **entries()** returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]
